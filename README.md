# Self-Driving Car - JavaScript
- Course by freeCodeCamp
- Neural network using JavaScript with no libraries.
- How to implement the car driving mechanics, how to define the environment, how to simulate some sensors, how to detect collisions, and how to make the car control itself using a neural network.
- The course covers how artificial neural networks work, by comparing them with the real neural networks in our brain. You will learn how to implement a neural network and how to visualize it so we can see it in action.
